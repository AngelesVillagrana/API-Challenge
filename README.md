This is for the homework 6 of the bootcamp

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks designed to analyze weather data and suggest vacation destinations based on the climate. The notebooks are `WeatherPy` and `VacationPy`.

## WeatherPy

The `WeatherPy` notebook generates a random list of cities and uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for those cities. It then performs analysis and visualizations on this data.

### Features

- Generation of random geographic coordinates.
- Determination of nearby cities using the `citipy` library.
- Retrieval of weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Analysis of correlations between various weather variables.
- Visualization of weather data in graphs.

## VacationPy

The `VacationPy` notebook takes the weather data generated by `WeatherPy` and suggests vacation destinations based on ideal weather conditions.

### Features

- Reading weather data from the file generated by `WeatherPy`.
- Filtering vacation destinations based on climate preferences (e.g., temperature and humidity).
- Visualization of suggested destinations on an interactive map.


## Resources

I used resources such as the assistance of ChatGPT, especially in debugging errors.
